The Gamow-Stern Elevator Puzzle

```{r, setup}
# install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
import random
x = [1,2,3]
```
```{python}
print(x)
```

This function will tell us if the elevator in question is going up or down. If it returns True, it's going down. Otherwise, it's going up.
```{python}
def elevator():
    if random.randrange(1,7) <= 5:
        return True
    else:
        return False

data = [elevator() for i in range(100)]
```
